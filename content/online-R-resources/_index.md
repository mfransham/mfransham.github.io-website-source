title: Free online resources for learning statistics in R
---

One of the helpful things about using R is that there are many free resources and online books available to learn from.  Here are some of the resources I have found particularly helpful.  

### Introductions to doing applied statistics with R

RLadies Sydney [RYouWithMe course](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/)
- An introductory course split into three: BasicBasics, CleanItUp (data manipulation), VizWhiz (data visualisation), MarkyMark (output in RMarkdown).  Some very nice video walk-throughs
- BasicBasics 1 has a very nice video introducing RStudio that will really help with orientation.  Also has some very good advice about good working practices – having a data folder, having a script folder, working with RStudio projects
- BasicBasics 2 talks about loading packages – also a very good, user friendly introduction
- BasicBasics 3 is about loading data and having an initial look at it

[Modern dive](https://moderndive.com/index.html) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim
- This book includes a very nice introduction to R and RStudio in chapter 1 using `flights` data
- Chapter 2-4 cover basic data science: visualisation, data manipulation, importing and cleaning data
- Chapter 5-6 cover data modelling
- Chapter 7-10 cover statistical inference, including using bootstrap as an alternative to parametric methods

[Intro to statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) by Dani Navarro
- Basic statistics for psychologists online book written by one of the RLadies Sydney group
- Basic data manipulation and statistical theory, with emphasis on ANOVA, regression and factorial ANOVA, plus an intro to Bayesian statistics

### Sources of quick tips and tricks

Obviously there's your [favourite search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/); less obviously there is a peer (and often very expert) [help forum on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

[Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/) by Rob Kabacoff
- quick introductions to how to implement a range of statistical methods

[R Cookbook](https://rc2e.com/) second edition by James Long and Paul Teetor
- a book with a large number of 'how to' recipes

[Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) by Winston Chang
- similar idea to the Long & Teetor book, but with less detail
- particularly useful for [how to modify charts in ggplot2](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)

### More on data science and programming in R

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
- Co-authored by Hadley Wickham, the person responsible for developing the `tidyverse`.  Exploration, wrangling, programming, modelling, communicating 

[Hand-on programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)
- Chapters 1-3 cover a basic dice-rolling project that introduces basic arithmetic, functions, objects, script files and help

[Getting use to R, RStudio and RMarkdown](https://rbasics.netlify.app/index.html) 
- Quite a nice short book, with quite a lot of emphasis on basic programming concepts and RMarkdown

[RStudio ‘basics’ primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1) 
- Visualisation basics: the basics of using ggplot to visualise data
- Programming basics: functions, arguments, objects, vectors, types, lists, packages.  Short videos alongside quiz questions and R exercises to check comprehension


### Data visualisation with ggplot2

[ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by Hadley Wickham
- The original book, online version 

[ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about)
- A visual guide to ggplot2

### Resources from RStudio

RStudio [suggested resources for beginners](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)

RStudio [webinars](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/)
- Loads of useful stuff but videos are approx. 50 mins each so a bit much for the beginner
