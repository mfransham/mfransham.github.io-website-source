title: Free online resources for learning statistics in R
---

There are many free resources and online books available to learn from.  Here is a small selection that I have found useful.  

### Introductions to doing applied statistics with R

RLadies Sydney [RYouWithMe course](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/): An introductory course split into three: BasicBasics, CleanItUp (data manipulation), VizWhiz (data visualisation), MarkyMark (output in RMarkdown).  Some very nice video walk-throughs

[Modern dive](https://moderndive.com/index.html) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim: This book includes a very nice introduction to R and RStudio in chapter 1 using `flights` data.  Chapters 2-4 cover basic data science; Chapters 5-6 cover data modelling; Chapters 7-10 cover statistical inference, including using bootstrap as an alternative to parametric methods

[Intro to statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/) by Dani Navarro: basic statistics for psychologists online book written by one of the RLadies Sydney group, with an emphasis on ANOVA, regression and factorial ANOVA, plus an intro to Bayesian statistics

### Sources of quick tips and tricks

Using your [favourite search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/) is often a quick and easy way to get an answer to a problem 

There is a peer (and often very expert) [help forum on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

[Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/) by Rob Kabacoff: quick introductions to how to implement a range of statistical methods

[R Cookbook](https://rc2e.com/) second edition by James Long and Paul Teetor: a book with a large number of 'how to' recipes

[Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) by Winston Chang: similar idea to the Long & Teetor book, but with less detail.  Particularly useful for [how to modify charts in ggplot2](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)

### More on data science and programming in R

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund: co-authored by Hadley Wickham, the person responsible for developing the `tidyverse`.  Exploration, wrangling, programming, modelling, communicating 

[Hand-on programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/): Chapters 1-3 cover a basic dice-rolling project that introduces basic arithmetic, functions, objects, script files and help

[Getting use to R, RStudio and RMarkdown](https://rbasics.netlify.app/index.html): a short book, with a lot of emphasis on basic programming concepts and RMarkdown

[RStudio ‘basics’ primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1): visualisation basics - the basics of using ggplot to visualise data; programming basics - functions, arguments, objects, vectors, types, lists, packages.  Short videos alongside quiz questions and R exercises to check comprehension


### Data visualisation with ggplot2

[ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by Hadley Wickham: an online version of the original book on ggplot2

[ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about): a visual guide to ggplot2


### Resources from RStudio

RStudio [suggested resources for beginners](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)

RStudio [webinars](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/): lots of useful stuff. Videos are approx. 50 mins each, so many are more appropriate for intermediate / advanced R users


### Meta-analysis

[Doing Meta-Analysis in R](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/) by Harrer *et al.*: a comprehensive applied guide, with very useful links to free resources on the theory

[How to perform a meta-analysis with R](https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/22/4/153) by Balduzzi *et al.*: a short tutorial in the *Evidence-Based Mental Health* on doing meta-analysis with the package `meta`

[R packages for meta-analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/view=MetaAnalysis): an overview of the myriad R packages available for meta-analysis


### Survey analysis

[Survey analysis in R](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/): the homepage of the `survey` package, written and maintained by Thomas Lumley
