I am a social data scientist using quantitative methods, social science theory and computational approaches to study [geographic inequality](https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038520975593), [poverty](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-017-9242-6), [demography](https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.2327) and [public policy](https://doi.org/10.1111/spol.12768).  Other (polite) things people have called me: geographer, economist, sociologist, statistician, data visualiser, demographer, cartographer. Take your pick!  I start the day with [`library(tidyverse)`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

I work at the Department of Social Policy & Intervention, University of Oxford, where I am the Senior Departmental Research Lecturer in Quantitative Methods.  I am a co-investigator on the [*Linking National and Regional Inequality* project](https://sites.google.com/view/regional-inequality/), a comparative study of trends in geographic income inequality in Europe and North America.  I teach introductory and advanced quantitative methods in the department, convene the [Modern Methods in Social Policy and Intervention Research](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr8G5YP2Gk1TYwAtBF90cHnaMcQwyret) seminar series and run the Methods Hub, an advisory service for DPhil (PhD) students.  

I am also a Research Fellow at [Wolfson College, Oxford](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/), a Visiting Fellow at the [International Inequalities Institute (III)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities) of the London School of Economics & Political Science, trustee of the [British Society for Population Studies](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/research/Research-clusters/british-society-for-population-studies) and an advisor to the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) on the UK Population Theme Advisory Board and the Government Statistical Service Migration Expert Group.   

Outside work I run the All Stars section of [Kidlington Cricket Club](https://www.kidlingtoncricket.com/) as an ECB qualified coach, am a member of [Oxford and District Action on Child Poverty](https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/18550073.oxford-group-calls-government-end-child-poverty-city/), an active advocate for [roads that are safe by design](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-60478638), and a singer who passably plays accompanying instruments.
