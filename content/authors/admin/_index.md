I am Departmental Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at the Department of Social Policy & Intervention, University of Oxford.  I am interested in spatial economic inequality, its measurement, causes and consequences; the social and economic policies that aim to address these inequalities; and the spatial impact of public policy that is 'place blind' but nonetheless has uneven geographic effects.  I have interests in population geography and the methods used in the production of official demographic statistics.  

I am also a Junior Research Fellow at [Wolfson College, Oxford](https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/), and a Visiting Fellow at the [International Inequalities Institute (III)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/International-Inequalities) of the London School of Economics & Political Science.  

### Interests
- The geography of economic and health inequalities in the UK
- Social policy, especially income support, housing, labour market policy and local government
- Demography including official population statistics methodologies
- Quantitative methods, statistical analysis in R and computational social science
