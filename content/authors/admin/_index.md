I am a researcher at the International Inequalities Institute (III) of the London School of Economics & Political Science.  At the III I am a postdoctoral researcher on two projects: a mixed-methods study of polarisation and inequality in four English towns; and a research theme on ‘Cities, Jobs and the Knowledge Economy’, exploring what the latest phase of technological change means for spatial economic inequality in the UK. 

I completed my DPhil in November 2018 at Oxford’s School of Geography and the Environment with a thesis titled ‘Understanding neighbourhood income poverty dynamics in England’. My doctoral research examines the dynamics of income poverty – how the risk of poverty changes over time within households and within places - at neighbourhood level in England. 

### Interests
